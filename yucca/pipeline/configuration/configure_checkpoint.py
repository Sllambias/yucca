@dataclass
class CkptConfig:
    """
    This class serves to preserve information between runs and should thus be extended to include
    information that must not be overwritten by each run.

    The LightningModule will call save_hyperparameters each time is it instantiated. This includes:
    starting training the first time, starting finetuning, continuing an interrupted training,
    starting inference. And each time the hyperparameters will be overwritten.

    ckpt_path will preserve the path to the original weights - this will by default also be saved
    when finetuning is started, but if finetuning is stopped and then started again the path is wiped.

    ckpt_seed ensures that we can continue from the same seed - this is mostly relevant for continuing
    interrupted trainings, but will also affect finetuning.

    ckpt_plans allows us to load plans from the checkpoint - this is used in inference where we may
    not be able to find a preprocessed folder with a plans.json.

    ckpt_wandb_id allows us to group runs by their "parent" wandb_id - this is useful for visualizing
    groups of finetuning runs by their source model/run.
    NB: THIS WILL NOT BE USED TO RESUME LOGGER STATES. Resuming loggers is currently not supported.
